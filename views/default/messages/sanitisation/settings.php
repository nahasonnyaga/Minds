Elgg couldn't find its settings file. Most of Elgg's settings will be handled for you, but we need you to supply your database details. To do this:

1. Rename engine/settings.example.php to settings.php in your Elgg installation.

2. Open it with a text editor and enter your MySQL database details. If you don't know these, ask your system administrator or technical support for help.
