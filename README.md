## Introduction
Minds is the free and open-source social networking platform.

This *readme* file should hopefuly explain all you need to get started, if not, please add to it or email **mark@minds.com**.

----


## Installation

We recommend you use our vagrant/chef cookbook for quick setup. https://github.com/Minds/minds-cookbook

### Requirements
- PHP 5.4+
- Nodejs (npm)
- Cassandra
- Nginx
- RabbitMQ (ability to disable to low traffic sites coming soon)
- Unix/Linux

_Optional_
- Neo4j (for suggested users)
- Elasticsearch (for search only)
- Redis (for caching in clustered environments)
- MongoDB (for boost functions)
- Cinemr (for video features only)

### Development Tools

##### Composer

- Run `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`

##### NPM

- Visit https://nodejs.org/ and install nodejs

##### Gulp

- Run `sudo npm install -g gulp`


### Building

- `gulp postinstall` - this generates the typings for TypeScript. (you should only have to run this after an update)
- `gulp build.dev` - run this after any changes to compile to javascript


### Generate new docs (core devs only)

- php vendor/bin/apigen generate -s src -d ./docs/api

# The below documentation needs updating

## Getting started
Minds is gradually implementing an Object Orientated code base. Elgg functions can still be called, but it is preferred for new plugins to follow the following structure.


### Calling the database
Minds implements Cassandra as its database. Cassandra is a NoSQL datastore.

You should generally store your indexes on **write** and retrieve later with a lookup query.

##### Example of indexes
```
$index = new \Minds\Core\Data\indexes();

$guids = $index->get('object:blog', array('limit'=>12, 'offset'=>''));

//adding and index, or to the index
$index->set('index:key:separated:by:colon', array('key'=>'value'));

```
##### Example user lookup
```
$email = 'mark@minds.com'
$lookup = new \Minds\Core\Data\lookup();

$guid = $lookup->get($email, array('limit'=>1));
$user = new \Minds\Entities\user($guid);

```

--------
### Entities
Elgg's 'classes' folder is large and unstructured. Entities have now been moved to their own folder in **engine/entities** and can be called with the new namespace **Minds\Entities**.

```
use Minds\Entities;
// load a user
$user = Entities\User('mark);

// load an object
$object = Entities\Object(1234345662);
```

--------
### Writing a plugin
The core Minds plugins are gradually being migrated to the newly structured Minds OOP method. OOP (Object Orientated PHP) provides a much cleaner code base and avoids replicated code and complexity.

##### Setup
- You need a manifest file
- You need a file with the same name as your folder eg. market. This is your init file and plugin controller.

##### Init file
Below is an example of how to start your plugin.

```
<?php
namespace minds\plugin\myplugin;

use Minds\Core;

class myplugin extends core\plugin{
	public function init(){
		//this is called upon every page load.
	}
}
```
##### Handling pages
The old Elgg page handler only supported *GET* requests by default and brought with it an uneeded level of complexity.

```
	//place this in the init of your plugin
	public funciton init(){
		\Minds\Core\Router::registerRoutes(array(
			'/myplugin' => '\minds\plugin\myplugin\pages\default',
			'/myplugin/another_page' => '\minds\plugin\myplugin\pages\another_page'
		));
	}

```

For example, when you hit http://MYSITE/myplugin, minds will now load your page handler found in **mod/myplugin/pages/default.php** and it should have the following structure

```
<?php
namespace minds\plugin\myplugin\pages;

use minds\interfaces;
use Minds\Core;
class default extends core\page inherits Interfaces\page{
	public function get($pages){
		echo "This is my plugin default page";
	}
	public function post($pages){}
	public function put($pages){}
	public function delete($pages){}
}
```
