## Introduction
Minds is a scalable and fully functional social engine built on top of Elgg. Some functions should feel familiar to Elgg developers, however we have made some changes major code changes to create a more scalable and less complex code base. 

This *readme* file should hopefuly explain all you need to get started, if not, please add to it or email **mark@minds.com**.

----


## Installation
### Requirements
- PHP 5.4+
- Cassandra
- Nginx (recommended)
- Unix/Linux (recommened)
- Elasticsearch (for search only)
- Cinemr (for video features only)

### Setup
- Go to localhost/install.php and follow the instruction. (debugging may be needed)

--------

## Getting started
Minds is gradually implementing an Object Orientated code base. Elgg functions can still be called, but it is preferred for new plugins to follow the following structure.


### Calling the database
Minds implements Cassandra as its database. Cassandra is a NoSQL datastore, and as such we have removed the relational queries used by Elgg. 

You should generally store your indexes on **write** and retrieve later with a lookup query.

##### Example of indexes
```
$index = new \minds\core\data\indexes();

$guids = $index->get('object:blog', array('limit'=>12, 'offset'=>''));

//adding and index, or to the index
$index->set('index:key:separated:by:colon', array('key'=>'value'));

```
##### Example user lookup
``` 
$email = 'mark@minds.com'
$lookup = new \minds\core\data\lookup();

$guid = $lookup->get($email, array('limit'=>1));
$user = new \minds\entities\user($guid);

```

--------
### Entities
Elgg's 'classes' folder is large an unstructured. Entities have now been moved to their own folder in **engine/entities** and can be called with the new namespace **minds\entities**.

```
use minds\entities;
// load a user
$user = entities\user('mark);

// load an object
$object = entities\object(1234345662);
```

--------
### Writing a plugin
The core Minds plugins are gradually being migrated to the newly structured Minds OOP method. OOP (Object Orientated PHP) provides a much cleaner code base and avoids replicated code and complexity. 

##### Setup
- You need a manifest file
- You need a file with the same name as your folder eg. market. This is your init file and plugin controller.

##### Init file
Below is an example of how to start your plugin.

```
<?php 
namespace minds\plugin\myplugin;

use minds\core;

class myplugin extends core\plugin{
	public function init(){
		//this is called upon every page load. 
	}
}
```
##### Handling pages
The old Elgg page handler only supported *GET* requests by default and brought with it an uneeded level of complexity. 

```
	//place this in the init of your plugin
	public funciton init(){
		\minds\core\router::registerRoutes(array(
			'/myplugin' => '\minds\plugin\myplugin\pages\default',
			'/myplugin/another_page' => '\minds\plugin\myplugin\pages\another_page'
		));
	}

```

For example, when you hit http://MYSITE/myplugin, minds will now load your page handler found in **mod/myplugin/pages/default.php** and it should have the following structure

```
<?php 
namespace minds\plugin\myplugin\pages;

use minds\interfaces;
use minds\core;
class default extends core\page inherits interfaces\page{
	public function get($pages){
		echo "This is my plugin default page";
	}
	public function post($pages){}
	public function put($pages){}
	public function delete($pages){}
}
```
