
Elgg 1.0 installation

This is a placeholder file, and will be rewritten before the official
launch. However, here are some basic instructions.  Commercial
support is available for Elgg; email info@elgg.com for more details.


CORE REQUIREMENTS

    * Apache web server with the following modules:
          o mod_rewrite
          o PHP (see below) 
    * MySQL 5+
    * PHP 5.2+ as an Apache mod (not in CGI mode or safe mode) 
      with the following libraries:
          o GD
          o JSON 

It is recommended that you increase the memory available to PHP
threads beyond the standard 8 or 12M, and increase the maximum
uploaded filesize (which defaults to 2M). In both cases, this 
can be found in your php.ini. 

INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Upload Elgg

Upload Elgg to your site's document root. Create a folder for 
Elgg to store files, preferably underneath the document root. 
Make sure that the folder has the proper permissions, for example:

chmod 777 /home/mysite/data
Create a database

Create a database for Elgg to store its data. Because of Elgg's 
ability to host multiple sites you will only have to do this once.

2.  Setup

Once you've completed the previous step, point your browser to your 
site. You'll be greeted by the Elgg installer. Once it's set up a
few essential files, the installer will ask for the database details
(database username, password, database name and table prefix) if not
already set up in the previous step, and some basic details for 
setting up your first (primary) Elgg site, where Elgg will already
have guessed some initial values:

    * The name of your site
    * The site URL
    * The full path to your site root on your disk
    * The full path to the directory where uploaded files will be 
      stored (the data folder you created earlier)
    * The default language code for your site
    * The type of default view (leave as default for now) 

After this step you will be prompted to create an initial user. This
user will be the first system administrator. This is the last step, 
and you'll be ready to start working with your new Elgg site.
