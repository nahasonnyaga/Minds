~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Kaltura's default content license is under CC. However - this is
completely under the partner decision - for deployments where the
content should be secured or private this only is a matter of
definitions.

If you are using the hosted edition on Kaltura.com please contact the
Kaltura professional support team (through
http://corp.kaltura.com/support/form/project/13) .

If you are using a self hosted Kaltura CE or Enterprise...
your content is not a part of the network by default so nothing need
to be changed.

The license of the projects that are a core part of the Kaltura
Platform is GPL v3 (AGPL or otherwise known as GNU Affero),
derivative works are also automatically licensed under GPL v3.

The plugin/extensions that are developed by 3rd party developers for
other Platforms (e.g. Elgg plugin, Alfresco extension, TikiWiki-Kaltura
extension…) are bound to the developer's license of choice.
