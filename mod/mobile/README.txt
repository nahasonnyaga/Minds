Mobile 3.0
==========
Thank you for using Mobile 3.0 for elgg. This plugin is designed to give you the basics to mobilize your elgg site. This mobile plugin works very much like a theme. All of the views can be found in views/mobile. You can create customised views for your plugin by placing the relevant view files (in the same way you would the default view) in the mobile folder.
