At the end of the day though, we cannot offer a 100% guarantee that your messages won't be hacked.</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Otherwise our mantra is "We have nothing to hide!" and all site data created here is licensed to the world under the <a href="/web/20130806055502/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;<a href="/web/20130806055502/http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a> because we think that people have a right to such accessibility that is generally not allowed by other networks. &nbsp;The main purpose of the internet is to share information. &nbsp;This is how it grows and evolves. &nbsp;The internet can't exist if we don't share our data, and the truth is that it is next to impossible to use the web without sharing your tracks. &nbsp;Everything is streaming and being recorded somewhere, and it is up to you to keep this in your mind and share responsibly.</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></p>
