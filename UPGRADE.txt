ELGG UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the new version of Elgg from elgg.org or a mirror.

2. Overwrite your existing Elgg files. Any modifications should
   have been written within plugins, so that they are not lost
   on overwriting. If this is not the case, take care to
   maintain your modifications, although Elgg is not guaranteed
   to work correctly in this instance. 

3. Visit http://your-elgg-site-URL/upgrade.php

4. If you haven't already done so, install your crontab (UNIX ONLY)

   Cron is a UNIX command which allows programs to be run at set 
   times of the day.

   If you want to take advantage of some of the maintenance 
   functions such as log rotation or garbage collection, you must 
   install a cron tab to trigger these events.

   There is an example crontab called crontab.example, edit this 
   with the details of your site and install it with the command.
